        <p>I've been looking forward to starting my first project of this type. I have gathered the necessary content to create a bioSite for my chosen subject. I was not sure what I wanted to choose for the color palette at first. However, through my interview with the subject, I was able to identify the colors I would use. Orange is included because that is the subject's favorite color. I wanted a clean look for the webpage, but also a warm feeling to it. With the sketch I made, I could pinpoint where the colors would be applied for each section. I'm a natural creator, so I love to be hands-on and build things.</p>

        <p>Creating the sketch was one of the most entertaining parts of the assignment. While identifying the hobbies and accomplishments of the subject, in my mind, everything was falling into place. I was sketching the information I received into a mental template of the sketch I drew. Some modifications may be required, but I have an excellent foundation to build on.</p>

        <p>The subject is passionate about contributing to society by making a difference in children's education with the knowledge and experience she has gained. Her focus is on K-12 kids and their teachers in providing the best computer science and technology education curriculum. Her motivation is to make communities a better place through technology education. However, her hobbies also inspire our world's natural beauty. It reminds us that even though we can advance technologically, nature and its abundant goods are essential for our well-being. She is also passionate about music, as she loves playing the guitar.</p>

        <p>I'm excited about building these three pages and see how a sketch and some creativity have turned into my first bioSite.</p>
