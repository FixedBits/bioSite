                    <p> <strong>Natalia Soto</strong> is the daughter of two hard-working Peruvian immigrants and a Computer Science graduate from the University
                        of Utah. She is passionate about increasing diversity in STEM and learning about the latest technologies. She is
                        currently working as a software developer in Salt Lake City, UT, and plans to pursue a master's degree in the Fall of
                        2023.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her favorite hobbies are listening to audio books, running, hiking mountainous slopes, and trying out new
                        cuisines. Something interesting about Natalia is that she created a small passive-income business on Etsy selling
                        printable party kits so that she could go to school without worrying about working long shifts at a job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Natalia seeks to explore the realm of educational technology as an Instructional Designer for computer science in the next few years
                        because of her fascination with how humans learn best. Specifically, she is interested in working with K-12 kids and
                        their educators to provide the best computer science and technology curriculum available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She has worked with local diversity groups to promote women in tech and helped organize computer donations for a local kidsâ€™ coding club called Club Ability. Natalia believes that kids simply need the right encouragement to unlock and reach their potential. She is
                        open to new opportunities in educational software development and is constantly working to stay up-to-date within her
                        field.
